# ReactNativeShowCaseApp

I found myself loving animation 🥰 & gesture 📲☝🏻  so I decide to take time to implementation the animation which i found on [http://dribbble.com/](http://dribbble.com/).

At the time i was create this repo, I found that reanimate2 doesn't has layout animation, so I decide to create simple animation which inspired from [http://animate.style](http://animate.style/). It kinda sad that 😥 when i almost finish this library, **_reanimated2_** is release alpha layout animation, so i decide to add other animation to this repo instead of idea which inspired from [http://animate.style](http://animate.style/).
